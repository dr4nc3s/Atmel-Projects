#Atmel-Projects#

Any adventures I take (outside of work) in Atmel MCUs will go here. 

##SAMC21J##

Playing around with this and writing helper libraries to interface with the peripherals in this MCU. Goal will be to write applications without using Atmel Software Framework (ASF) and write my own utility functions. 

<h4>Peripheral support to be implemented</h4>
*List includes mini-tasks to utilize the peripheral support*

1. GPIO control - pushbutton inputs, LED controls
2. I2C driver - interface with SHT35 breakout board (MOD-10)
3. SPI driver - interface with Nokia 5110 LCD (<a href="http://www.embeddedadventures.com/84x48_Nokia_5110_LCD_display_LCD-8448GR.html">LCD8448-GR</a>)


###Coming Soon###
---
1. ATmega328P (without the Arduino support)
2. SAML21J (pending my own breakout board and decent working utilities from SAMC21)
